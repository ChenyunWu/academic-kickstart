I'm a sixth-year PhD student from [Computer Vision Lab](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/) at [CICS UMass Amherst](https://www.cics.umass.edu/), advised by Prof. [Subhransu Maji](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~smaji/). Before joining UMass, I obtained my bachelor's degree from [Peking University](http://english.pku.edu.cn/) in 2015 with double majors in physics and computer softwares.

I'm interested in broad topics in computer vision, especially the combination of vision and natural language. I study the joint modeling of visual and language signals, and leverage the supervision of language to further understand various visual domains including fine-grained categories, objects/stuff in images, visual textures, and videos.

**I'm expected to graduate in Summer 2021. I'm looking for research positions in the industry.** 

More details are covered in my [resume](files/ChenyunWu_UMass_ComputerVision_Fulltime.pdf) and [research statement](files/ChenyunWu_ResearchStatement.pdf).
